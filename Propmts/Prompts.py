          '\n\nTOOLS:\n------\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n\nGet Available ' \
          'Actions: Useful before you make decisions, this tool let you know what are your' \
          'available actions in this situation. The input to this tool should be ' \
          '\'ego\'.\nGet Available Lanes: useful when you want to know the available lanes' \
          'of the vehicles. like: I want to know the available lanes of the vehicle `ego`.' \
          'The input to this tool should be a string, representing the id of the ' \
          'vehicle.\nGet Lane Involved Car: useful whent want to know the cars may affect ' \
          'your action in the certain lane. Make sure you have use tool `Get Available ' \
          'Lanes` first. The input is a string, representing the id of the specific lane ' \
          'you want to drive on, DONNOT input multiple lane_id once.\nIs Change Lane ' \
          'Confict With Car: useful when you want to know whether change lane to a ' \
          'specific lane is confict with a specific car, ONLY when your decision is ' \
          'change_lane_left or change_lane_right. The input to this tool should be a ' \
          'string of a comma separated string of two, representing the id of the lane you ' \
          'want to change to and the id of the car you want to check.\nIs Acceleration ' \
          'Conflict With Car: useful when you want to know whether acceleration is safe ' \
          'with a specific car, ONLY when your decision is accelerate. The input to this ' \
          'tool should be a string, representing the id of the car you want to check.\nIs ' \
          'Keep Speed Conflict With Car: useful when you want to know whether keep speed ' \
          'is safe with a specific car, ONLY when your decision is keep_speed. The input ' \
          'to this tool should be a string, representing the id of the car you want to ' \
          'check.\nIs Deceleration Safe: useful when you want to know whether deceleration' \
          'is safe, ONLY when your decision is decelerate.The input to this tool should be' \
          'a string, representing the id of the car you want to check.\nDecision-making ' \
          'Instructions: This tool gives you a brief intruduction about how to ensure that' \
          'the action you make is safe. The input to this tool should be a string, which ' \
          'is ONLY the action name.\n\nThe way you use the tools is by specifying a json ' \
          'blob.\nSpecifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the' \
          'tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going ' \
          'here).\nThe only values that should be in the "action" field are one of: Get ' \
          'Available Actions, Get Available Lanes, Get Lane Involved Car, Is Change Lane ' \
          'Confict With Car, Is Acceleration Conflict With Car, Is Keep Speed Conflict ' \
          'With Car, Is Deceleration Safe, Decision-making Instructions\n\nThe $JSON_BLOB ' \
          'should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. ' \
          'Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:\n```\n{\n  "action": $TOOL_NAME,\n  ' \
          '"action_input": $INPUT\n}\n```\n\nALWAYS use the following format when you use ' \
          'tool:\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\nThought: always summarize ' \
          'the tools you have used and think what to do next step by ' \
          'step\nAction:\n```\n$JSON_BLOB\n```\nObservation: the result of the action\n...' \
          '(this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)\n\nWhen you have a final ' \
          'answer, you MUST use the format:\nThought: I now know the final answer, then ' \
          'summary why you have this answer\nFinal Answer: the final answer to the ' \

          'Here are your attentions points:\n          \n1. DONOT finish the task ' \
          'until you have a final answer. You must output a decision when you finish this ' \
          'task. Your final output decision must be unique and not ambiguous. For example ' \
          'you cannot say "I can either keep lane or accelerate at current time".\n2. You ' \
          'can only use tools mentioned before to help you make decision. DONOT fabricate ' \
          'any other tool name not mentioned.\n3. Remember what tools you have used, DONOT' \
          'use the same tool repeatedly.\n3. You need to know your available actions and ' \
          'available lanes before you make any decision.\n4. Once you have a decision, you' \
          'should check the safety with all the vehicles affected by your decision. Once ' \
          'it\'s safe, stop using tools and output it.\n5. If you verify a decision is ' \
          'unsafe, you should start a new one and verify its safety again from ' \
          'scratch.\n\n           \n Let\'s think step by step. Once ' \ 
          'you made a final decision, output it in the following format: \n\n' \
